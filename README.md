This was a project for my 2nd year, 2nd semester subject "Programming techniques".

The given task was to design an application that uses Java 8 streams and lamba expressions to iterate over a set of recorded activities and provide details on their length, distribution and types.

The exact grading criteria are in the _HW5_Grading.pdf_ file, which also contains a more complete task description.

A more detailed description of the project, the employed classes, design patterns used, use-cases covered, assumptions made and so on can be found in the _Assignment 5 Documentation.pdf_ file.
